\usage{
length_length(
  species_list = NULL,
  fields = NULL,
  server = c("fishbase", "sealifebase"),
  version = "latest",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{species_list}{A vector of scientific names (each element as "genus species"). If empty, a table for all fish will be returned.}

\item{server}{Either "fishbase" or "sealifebase".}

\item{version}{a version string for the database. See [available_releases()] for details.}
}
\value{
a table of lengths
}
\description{
return a table of lengths
}
\details{
This table contains relationships for the conversion of one length type to another for over 8,000
species of fish, derived from different publications, e.g. Moutopoulos and Stergiou (2002) and
Gaygusuz et al (2006), or from fish pictures, e.g. Collette and Nauen (1983), Compagno (1984)
and Randall (1997). The relationships, which always refer to centimeters, may consist either of a
regression linking two length types, of the form:
 Length type (2) = a + b x Length type (1)
Length type (2) = b' x Length type (1)
The available length types are, as elsewhere in FishBase,
TL = total length;
FL = fork length;
SL = standard length;
WD = width (in rays);
OT = other type (to be specified in the Comment field).
When a version of equation (1) is presented, the length range, the number of fish used in the regression,
the sex and the correlation coefficient are presented, if available.
When a version of equation (2) is presented, the range and the correlation coefficient are omitted,
as the ratio in (2) will usually be estimated from a single specimen, or a few fish covering a narrow
range of lengths.

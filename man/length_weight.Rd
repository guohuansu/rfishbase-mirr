  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{species_list}{A vector of scientific names (each element as "genus species"). If empty, a table for all fish will be returned.}

\item{fields}{subset to these columns.  (recommend to omit this and handle manually)}

\item{server}{Either "fishbase" or "sealifebase".}

\item{version}{a version string for the database. See \code{\link[=available_releases]{available_releases()}} for details.}

\item{db}{database connection, now deprecated.}

\item{...}{additional arguments, currently ignored}
}
\value{
a table of length_weight information by species; see details
}
\description{
The LENGTH-WEIGHT table presents the a and b values of over 5,000
length-weight relationships of the form W = a x Lb, pertaining to about over 2,000 fish species.
}
\details{
See references for official documentation.  From FishBase.org:
Length-weight relationships are important in fisheries science,
notably to raise length-frequency samples to total catch, or to
estimate biomass from underwater length observations.
The units of length and weight in FishBase are centimeter and gram, respectively.
Thus when length-weight relationships are not in cm-g, the intercept 'a'
is transformed as follows:

a'(cm, g) = a (mm, g)*10^b
a'(cm, g) = a (cm, kg)*1000
a'(cm, g) = a (mm, mg)*10^b/1000
a'(cm, g) = a (mm, kg)\emph{10^b}1000

However, published length-weight relationships are sometimes difficult to use,
as they may be based on a length measurement type (e.g., fork length) different
from ones length measurements (expressed e.g., as total length).
Therefore, to facilitate conversion between length types, an additional
LENGTH-LENGTH table, #' presented below, was devised which presents linear
regressions or ratios linking length types (e.g., FL vs. TL).
We included a calculated field with the weight of a 10 cm fish (which
should be in the order of 10 g for normal, fusiform shaped fish),
to allow identification of gross errors, given knowledge of the body
form of a species.
